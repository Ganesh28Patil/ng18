               interpolation, property Binding


           => from .html to .ts
               event binding

2. Twob Way Data Binding
           => using ngModel

3. Using signal ( angular 17 onwards )


Note: Every class has a default method called a constructor. 
      A constructor is a special method that is automatically called 
      when an instance of the class is created.

Note : 
      Interpolation is written in double curlly bracket {{ }}      
      <div class = {{myClassName}}>Danger</div>  

      Property Binding is written in square bracket [] 
      <input typle="text" [value] = "courseName" />

      Event Binding is done as bellow
      showData(){
          console.log("This is an exaple of event binding");
          // here click event is binided to function "showData()" the button using banana bracket.
      }
      <button (click)="showData()" >SHOW DATA</button>  

      Two way binding is given bellow 
      isIndian: boolean = false;  
      <input value="checkbox" [(ngModel)]="isIndian" />

      firstName = signal("Angular 18");
      this signal is invoked in html code as method  <h1> {{ firstName() }} </h2>
